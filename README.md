# Dungeons & Dragons Character sheet app

The backend of this app is hosted on Railway, but it is currently **Not working** because I have not purchased a price plan.

*When* I get it running again, here's what you can expect from this app:
- Creating and storing an **unlimited amount of characters**. The creation process helps you with calculations and does not leave everything up to you. Skills, saving throws, attack & damage rolls and anything else you need to calculate happens automatically, all you need to do is add the base stats and the proficiencies/expertises, which the UI simplifies a lot
- A selection of the basic D&D 5e classes and races, but also some from DLC's
- Very un-opinionated logic when storing attacks, spells, items and anything else. This means that there are a few presets that you can select, for example the damage type and damage itself, but you can create your own attacks from scratch, without limiting the amount of options.
- A section for features. You can store all of your character's features, whether it is something expendable or not, and you can view it in the character's main page. If it is expendable, you have the option of selecting the amount of charges and **when** it is going to recharge.
- Uses the [D&D 5e API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/) to bring you a selection of *most* of the spells available in the Official 5th Edition SRD. You can still add your own, in case you want to add homebrew stuff!
- Combat mode, where you can make changes to your character's HP in a very simple UI. You can also roll attack and damage dice.
- Notes for each character - there is a section for each character where you can keep notes for them or for the campaign you are in. In future updates I might add notes for different campaigns for each character, but not yet.
- Keeping track of your spell slots is very simple, as there is a 'Spell' mode (similar to combat mode) where you can view all your spells based on level. You can also expend and restore spell slots by clicking on the button next to each Spell Slot level.
- Long rest and short rest. There is a feature where you can long rest, restoring your character to full HP and anything else a long rest might do to you. That includes refreshing features that reload on-long rest; you don't have to do it manually every time. On short rest, you are prompted to decide how many (if any) hit dice you want to expend. Also all uses of any short-rest-reload features will be refreshed.

I am open to suggestions - I want to make this a free character management application, so people don't have to pay for something as simple as making their sessions easier and simpler.
